# Online Workday Scheduler

## Description

Challenge Module 05 Third Party API's - This challenge was a mind breaker trying to figure how to make it everything work how it supposed to but at the end seeing my work done is the best feeling ever; here I created a work scheduler which is actually useful to plan your day of work with a list of TODO's.

## Usage

The page will display the current time and day and the 8 hours of work for that day, all you need to do is type the TODO's for that hour right in the box of the hour and click the save button at the right hand side that way if the page is closed or reload by mistake your TODO's are still saved and showing. The hours that are in color gray means that they already passed, the hour in color red is the current hour and the hours in color green are the future hours coming up.
